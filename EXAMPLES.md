# SerpRateAI Time Series Explorer - Example Workflows

Quick demos to show Karina how the tool works.

## Example 1: Correlating Pressure and Temperature at BA1D

**Goal:** See if pressure and temperature co-vary in the borehole

1. In the checkbox panel, select:
   - ☑ BA1D Pressure
   - ☑ BA1D Temperature
2. Both time series appear stacked vertically, sharing the same x-axis
3. Click-drag on either plot to zoom into a time window
4. Notice both plots zoom together (linked x-axis)
5. Look for patterns: do pressure spikes coincide with temperature changes?

**Export:** Click "Download Plot" to get a matplotlib PNG of the current view

## Example 2: Earth Tides vs Bubble Count

**Goal:** Check if bubble activity correlates with tidal strain

1. Select:
   - ☑ Earth Tides
   - ☑ Bubble Count
2. Zoom to a few-day window where bubble count has activity
3. Compare the tidal signal timing with bubble events
4. Export the zoomed view for discussion

## Example 3: Weather Stack - Surface Conditions

**Goal:** View all meteorological variables together

1. Select:
   - ☑ Surface Pressure
   - ☑ Temperature (2m)
   - ☑ Daily Precipitation
   - ☑ Hourly Precipitation
2. Now you have 4 stacked plots, all linked
3. Zoom to a storm event (look for precip spikes)
4. See how pressure, temp, and precip relate during the event

## Example 4: Soil Profile - Depth Comparison

**Goal:** Compare soil temps and moisture across depth levels

1. Select all soil temps:
   - ☑ Soil Temp Level 1
   - ☑ Soil Temp Level 2
   - ☑ Soil Temp Level 3
   - ☑ Soil Temp Level 4
2. Zoom to a seasonal transition (e.g., fall cooling)
3. Notice the lag - deeper levels respond slower
4. Toggle on Soil Water layers to see moisture dynamics too

## Example 5: Full System View

**Goal:** Get the big picture

1. Select everything (or most datasets)
2. Zoom out to see the full time range
3. Identify interesting periods with multiple signals
4. Zoom into those periods for detailed analysis
5. Export specific views for presentations

## Tips

- **Pan:** Click and drag with the pan tool
- **Zoom:** Box select or scroll wheel
- **Reset:** Double-click to reset view
- **Export:** Downloads current zoomed region as publication-quality PNG
- **Linked axes:** All visible plots share the same time window
